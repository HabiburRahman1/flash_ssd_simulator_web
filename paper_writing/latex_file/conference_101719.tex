\section{Introduction}
Understanding the core concepts of Flash SSD can be a challenging task for students. Many of us face difficulties comprehending the intricate workings of Flash SSD due to the lack of foundational knowledge. Despite our efforts to find a web-based Flash SSD simulator, we were unable to locate one. Consequently, we took it upon ourselves to develop an easily understandable web-based simulator called Eyana: The SSD Simulator. The name "Eyana" was inspired by one of our team members' daughters.

Our simulator, Eyana, is designed with the aim of simplifying the comprehension of Flash SSD technology. It achieves this by providing visual demonstrations of crucial operations like Page, Block, Write, Read, Update, Delete, garbage collection, and the flash translation layer. The entire process of how transistors come together to form pages, and how pages combine to form blocks, ultimately creating an SSD, is visually presented in our simulator. Accompanied by comprehensive documentation, we clarify concepts such as Write Amplification, Wear Leveling, Parallelism, and Multi-Channel.

Through visualization, Eyana offers valuable insights into the functioning of Flash SSDs, shedding light on the selection of pages and blocks during various operations such as writing, reading, updating, and deleting. Furthermore, the simulator illustrates the intricate workings of the garbage collection process, adding to the overall understanding of Flash SSD technology.

By allowing users to upload files and observe real-time operations, our simulator empowers students to grasp the entire procedure within a short span of time. With a survey conducted to assess the effectiveness of our simulator in enhancing the understanding of Flash SSDs, we obtained valuable feedback. Remarkably, 99 per cent of the users found our simulator to be highly effective, rating it as one of the best available.

In this paper, we will delve into the details of Eyana: The SSD Simulator and provide a comprehensive overview of its features, functionalities, and the underlying concepts it aims to elucidate. We will also present the results of our survey, conducted to evaluate the simulator's effectiveness in facilitating the comprehension of Flash SSDs. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the educational resources available for students and researchers interested in Flash SSD technology.

\section{Floating Gate Transistor Simulator}

A Solid State Drive (SSD) is a cutting-edge data storage device based on flash memory technology, utilizing floating gate transistors to store data as electrical charges. Unlike traditional hard drives with moving mechanical parts, SSDs offer a multitude of advantages, including higher speed, enhanced reliability, and lower power consumption, making them the preferred choice for modern computing needs.

With the aid of our Floating Gate Transistor simulator, users can not only grasp the fundamental operations of writing, reading, and erasing data but also gain a comprehensive understanding of the key distinctions between Single-Level Cell (SLC), Multi-Level Cell (MLC), and Triple-Level Cell (TLC) technologies. The simulator offers a hands-on experience in programming floating gate transistors to store varying levels of charge, enabling users to observe the differences in data storage capacity and performance among these three memory cell types. By exploring these nuances, users can appreciate the significance of SLC, MLC, and TLC technologies in diverse applications and make informed decisions about their implementation based on specific use cases and performance requirements.

\subsection{Floating Gate Transistors - The Heart of SSDs}
Each SSD's fundamental building block is the floating gate transistor, consisting of a source, drain, silicon insulator, a floating gate, and a control gate. The magic of data storage happens when a high voltage is applied to the control gate, allowing electrons from the silicon substrate to tunnel through the silicon insulator and become trapped in the floating gate. This trapped charge represents the data and remarkably remains intact even when the power is turned off, making SSDs non-volatile.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=5cm]{paper_writing/latex_file/ssd_simulator_write.png}
    \caption{Writing in A Floating Gate Transistor}
    \label{fig:ssd_simulator_write}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Single Level Cell (SLC)}
Single Level Cell technology stores 1 bit of information per cell. When reading data, a low voltage is applied to the control gate. If electrons flow from the source to the drain, indicating a current, the data is interpreted as "0." Conversely, if no current flows, the data is interpreted as "1." SLC provides fast read and write speeds and is known for its high endurance and reliability.

\subsection{Multi Level Cell (MLC)}
Multi Level Cell (MLC) technology stores 2 bits of information per cell. To represent data, the control gate receives voltage divided into four threshold voltage ranges: 0-3 volts, 3-6 volts, 6-9 volts, and 9-12 volts. When voltage in the range of 0-3 volts is applied and current flows from source to drain, the data is "11." If no current flows, the voltage in the range of 3-6 volts is applied, resulting in the data being stored as "10." Similarly, if the voltage in the range of 6-9 volts is applied and current flows, the data is "01." Finally, if no current flows in the 6-9 volts range, the voltage in the range of 9-12 volts is applied, and the data is "00." MLC offers higher storage density than SLC, but it may have slightly slower performance and lower endurance.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=5cm]{paper_writing/latex_file/ssd_simulator_read.png}
    \caption{Multi Level Cell Floating Gate Transistor}
    \label{fig:ssd_simulator_read}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Triple Level Cell (TLC)}
Triple Level Cell (TLC) technology stores 3 bits of information per cell. The control gate receives voltage divided into eight threshold voltage ranges. With voltage ranges such as 0-1 volt, 1-2 volts, 2-3 volts, and more, TLC can represent eight different data states. For example, if a voltage in the range of 0-1 volt is applied and current flows, the data is "111." If no current flows, then the voltage in the range of 1-2 volts is applied, resulting in "110," and so on. TLC provides even higher storage density but may have lower endurance and slightly slower performance compared to SLC and MLC.

\subsection{Erasing Data and Write Wear-Out}
To erase data from an SSD, a high voltage is applied to the silicon substrate, causing electrons to move from the floating gate back to the substrate. This process is known as erasing. Frequent erasing and rewriting can lead to a phenomenon called "write wear-out," where some electrons might get trapped on the insulator (silicon dioxide), degrading the SSD over time.

\subsection{Wear Leveling}
To combat write wear-out and ensure uniform usage of cells, wear leveling is employed in SSDs. The wear leveling technique evenly distributes data writing across all the floating gate transistors. By preventing certain cells from wearing out faster than others, wear leveling enhances the overall lifespan and reliability of the SSD, making it more durable and efficient.

\subsection{Organizing Transistors in SSDs}
In SSDs, multiple floating gate transistors are organized into pages, several pages form a block, and multiple blocks constitute the entire drive's storage. This hierarchical organization allows for efficient data management and access. By writing data in pages and blocks, SSDs can perform faster read and write operations, optimizing the overall performance of the storage device.


\section{Organization of an SSD}
In our SSD simulator, we have utilized Single Level Cell (SLC) transistors to create pages. Each page in our simulator can store 4 KB of data, and to achieve this capacity, we have employed approximately 32,768 floating gate transistors for each page.

The organization of our SSD simulator is structured as follows: Four pages are combined to form one block, and four blocks are further grouped to create one plane. Two planes are then integrated to form a die, and two dies are packaged together, resulting in one channel.

The user initiates commands through the host interface, with Serial ATA (SATA) and PCI Express (PCIe) being the most common interfaces for newly released SSDs. The SSD controller's processor receives these commands and then transfers them to the flash controller. Additionally, SSDs are equipped with embedded RAM memory, primarily used for caching data and storing mapping information.

Our SSD simulator's architecture, as illustrated in Figure 3, provides an efficient and reliable platform for evaluating the performance of NAND Flash devices in various scenarios. Figure 4 depicts the overall SSD architecture, illustrating how commands flow from the host interface to the flash controller, along with the presence of embedded RAM for caching and mapping data.

\section{Eyana: The SSD Simulator}
Eyana: The SSD Simulator describes the internal architecture of an SSD and visualizes the processes of Write, Read, Update, Garbage Collection, and Parallel Writing. Being a web-based simulator, anyone can access and use it to understand the core concepts of an SSD.

\subsection{Write}
When data is written to an SSD, the process involves creating a logical address that contains information about the uploaded files or programs requiring storage. This logical address is then mapped to a corresponding physical address, which specifies the specific physical page and block where the data is stored. The mapping table holds the information that facilitates this logical-to-physical address translation.
Throughout the write process, data is written in increments of the page size. As a result, even if a write operation only modifies a single byte, an entire page is written. This phenomenon, where more data is written than actually required, is known as write amplification.
\subsection{Making Data Storage Smarter: Insights from the Eyana SSD Simulator}
When we save stuff on a computer, we have to be smart about how we do it. Imagine the computer's storage as a big grid where we put our things. If we don't put things in the right places, we might use up more space than we actually need. This is what we call "write amplification."

Even if we're just putting a tiny bit of information, it can sometimes take up way more space than it should. Think about writing a short message on a huge sheet of paper – that's like using a lot of paper for a tiny message. In certain situations, even if you're just writing a single letter, it could end up using a whole big page, which is like using 16 pieces of paper. That's not very smart!

But there's more to the story. When we don't put our information in the right spots, the computer has to do extra work. It has to read the place where we want to add something, make changes, and then put it back. This extra work slows things down. Imagine you want to fix a sentence in a book, but instead of fixing only that sentence, you have to read the entire page, fix the sentence, and then put the page back. This extra step takes more time.

To work better, we have some simple rules to remember when putting our information:

\subsubsection{Write Enough} 
Avoid putting really tiny bits of information. It's better to write a bit more, like a whole sentence, so the computer can do its job faster. Usually, it's a good idea to write at least as much as you could fit on a book page, which is like 16 pieces of paper.

\subsubsection{Put Things in the Right Spots} 
When you write, make sure to put your stuff in the right places. It's like solving a puzzle – things fit better and work faster when they're in the correct spots.

\subsubsection{Group Small Stuff Together} 
Instead of writing lots of small things one after the other, it's smarter to gather them up first and then write them all together. It's a bit like putting all your small notes in one envelope before sending them, instead of sending each note separately.

By following these easy rules, the computer can work faster and use space more efficiently. It's like organizing your things neatly so everything runs smoothly.

And here's the cool part: we've put all these ideas into action in our online simulator, Eyana. You can see how it all works visually. This way, we're showing how these simple rules can make a big difference in how we use computers.

\subsection{Read}
The SSD read process involves receiving a logical address request, mapping it to a corresponding physical address using a mapping table, retrieving the data from the specified physical page and block in the NAND flash memory, and transferring the data to the requesting application or operating system.
\subsection{Update}
NAND-flash memory operates with a specific constraint: a page can be written to only if it is in the "free" state. When data needs to be changed or updated, the process involves a series of steps known as "read-modify-write." First, the content of the target page is copied into an internal register. Then, the required modifications are made to the data, and the updated version is stored in a different "free" page.
This "read-modify-write" operation occurs because the data cannot be updated in-place within the original page. Consequently, the "free" page, which is a separate and available page, is used to store the updated data. Once the new data has been successfully persisted to the drive, the original page is marked as "stale," indicating that it contains outdated information. The stale page remains in this state until it is eventually erased, and its space becomes available to be used for future write operations.
The "read-modify-write" process and the write amplification phenomenon described earlier are factors that affect the performance and lifespan of SSDs. Careful management of write operations and garbage collection techniques are employed to optimize SSD performance and ensure its long-term reliability.
\subsection{Garbage Collection}
Garbage collection erases outdated data in SSDs, ensuring efficient write processing. Our simulator traces stale data, which can be deleted manually or after a set time. This optimizes SSD performance and maximizes usable capacity.
\subsection{Allocation Schemes}
An allocation scheme dictates the process of selecting an available physical page to store a logical page on an SSD. To pinpoint a specific physical page, one must possess knowledge of the channel address, chip address, along with the die, plane, block, and page addresses, as illustrated in ``Fig.~\ref{fig:ssd_architecture}''. The comprehensive SSD address format is depicted in ``Fig.~\ref{fig:architecture_of_ssd_simulation}''.

Allocation schemes fall into two primary categories: static and dynamic.
\subsubsection{Static Allocation}
Static allocation involves initially assigning a logical page to a predetermined channel, chip, die, and plane before proceeding to allocate it to any available free physical pages within the plane. The allocation of channel, chip, die, and plane addresses to each logical page usually follows specific predetermined formulas, which define a particular allocation scheme.

``Fig.~\ref{fig:static_allocation}'' depicts six distinct static allocation schemes denoted as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6. As elaborated, each of these special static allocation schemes calculates channel, chip, die, and plane addresses for every logical page using specific formulas. In the subsequent discussion, we outline these formulas for each static allocation scheme. The relevant variables and operators required for these formulas are outlined in ``Table.~\ref{table:variables_explanation}''.
