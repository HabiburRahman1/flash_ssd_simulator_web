# Floating Gate Transistor Simulator
A Solid State Drive (SSD) is a cutting-edge data storage device based on flash memory technology, utilizing floating gate transistors to store data as electrical charges. Unlike traditional hard drives with moving mechanical parts, SSDs offer a multitude of advantages, including higher speed, enhanced reliability, and lower power consumption, making them the preferred choice for modern computing needs.

With the aid of our Floating Gate Transistor simulator, users can not only grasp the fundamental operations of writing, reading, and erasing data but also gain a comprehensive understanding of the key distinctions between Single-Level Cell (SLC), Multi-Level Cell (MLC), and Triple-Level Cell (TLC) technologies. The simulator offers a hands-on experience in programming floating gate transistors to store varying levels of charge, enabling users to observe the differences in data storage capacity and performance among these three memory cell types. By exploring these nuances, users can appreciate the significance of SLC, MLC, and TLC technologies in diverse applications and make informed decisions about their implementation based on specific use cases and performance requirements.

## Floating Gate Transistors - The Heart of SSDs
Each SSD's fundamental building block is the floating gate transistor, consisting of a source, drain, silicon insulator, a floating gate, and a control gate(figure 1). The magic of data storage happens when a high voltage(25v example) is applied to the control gate, allowing electrons from the silicon substrate to tunnel through the silicon insulator and become trapped in the floating gate. This trapped charge represents the data and remarkably remains intact even when the power is turned off, making SSDs non-volatile.
![Example Image](paper_writing/images/ssd_simulator_write.png)

## Single Level Cell (SLC):

Single Level Cell technology stores 1 bit of information per cell. When reading data, a low voltage is applied to the control gate. If electrons flow from the source to the drain, indicating a current, the data is interpreted as "0." Conversely, if no current flows, the data is interpreted as "1." SLC provides fast read and write speeds and is known for its high endurance and reliability.

## Multi Level Cell (MLC)

Multi Level Cell (MLC) technology stores 2 bits of information per cell. To represent data, the control gate receives voltage divided into four threshold voltage ranges: 0-3 volts, 3-6 volts, 6-9 volts, and 9-12 volts. When voltage in the range of 0-3 volts is applied and current flows from source to drain, the data is "11."(figure 2) If no current flows, the voltage in the range of 3-6 volts is applied, resulting in the data being stored as "10." Similarly, if the voltage in the range of 6-9 volts is applied and current flows, the data is "01." Finally, if no current flows in the 6-9 volts range, the voltage in the range of 9-12 volts is applied, and the data is "00." MLC offers higher storage density than SLC, but it may have slightly slower performance and lower endurance.
![Example Image](paper_writing/images/ssd_simulator_read.png)
## Triple Level Cell (TLC)

Triple Level Cell (TLC) technology stores 3 bits of information per cell. The control gate receives voltage divided into eight threshold voltage ranges. With voltage ranges such as 0-1 volt, 1-2 volts, 2-3 volts, and more, TLC can represent eight different data states. For example, if a voltage in the range of 0-1 volt is applied and current flows, the data is "111." If no current flows, then the voltage in the range of 1-2 volts is applied, resulting in "110," and so on. TLC provides even higher storage density but may have lower endurance and slightly slower performance compared to SLC and MLC.

## Erasing Data and Write Wear-Out

To erase data from an SSD, a high voltage is applied to the silicon substrate, causing electrons to move from the floating gate back to the substrate. This process is known as erasing. Frequent erasing and rewriting can lead to a phenomenon called "write wear-out," where some electrons might get trapped on the insulator (silicon dioxide), degrading the SSD over time.

## Wear Leveling

To combat write wear-out and ensure uniform usage of cells, wear leveling is employed in SSDs. The wear leveling technique evenly distributes data writing across all the floating gate transistors. By preventing certain cells from wearing out faster than others, wear leveling enhances the overall lifespan and reliability of the SSD, making it more durable and efficient.

## Organizing Transistors in SSDs

In SSDs, multiple floating gate transistors are organized into pages, several pages form a block, and multiple blocks constitute the entire drive's storage. This hierarchical organization allows for efficient data management and access. By writing data in pages and blocks, SSDs can perform faster read and write operations, optimizing the overall performance of the storage device.
# Organization of an SSD
In our SSD simulator, we have utilized Single Level Cell (SLC) transistors to create pages. Each page in our simulator can store 4 KB of data, and to achieve this capacity, we have employed approximately 32,768 floating gate transistors for each page.

The organization of our SSD simulator is structured as follows: Four pages are combined to form one block, and four blocks are further grouped to create one plane. Two planes are then integrated to form a die, and two dies are packaged together, resulting in one channel.

Here are the key specifications of our NAND Flash Device:

- Single Level Cell (SLC): Each transistor in our NAND Flash stores 1 bit of data.
- Page Size: Each page has a storage capacity of 4 KB.
- Block Size: A block comprises 16 KB of data, which is equivalent to 4 pages.
- Page Read: Reading data from a single page takes approximately 25 microseconds (μs).
- Page Program (Write): Writing data to a page requires about 200 microseconds (μs).
- Block Erase: Erasing a block takes around 1.5 milliseconds (ms).

The user initiates commands through the host interface, with Serial ATA (SATA) and PCI Express (PCIe) being the most common interfaces for newly released SSDs. The SSD controller's processor receives these commands and then transfers them to the flash controller. Additionally, SSDs are equipped with embedded RAM memory, primarily used for caching data and storing mapping information.

Our SSD simulator's architecture, as illustrated in Figure 3, provides an efficient and reliable platform for evaluating the performance of NAND Flash devices in various scenarios. Figure 4 depicts the overall SSD architecture, illustrating how commands flow from the host interface to the flash controller, along with the presence of embedded RAM for caching and mapping data.

## Write:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When data is written to an SSD, the process involves creating a logical address that contains information about the uploaded files or programs requiring storage. This logical address is then mapped to a corresponding physical address, which specifies the specific physical page and block where the data is stored. The mapping table holds the information that facilitates this logical-to-physical address translation.
Throughout the write process, data is written in increments of the page size. As a result, even if a write operation only modifies a single byte, an entire page is written. This phenomenon, where more data is written than actually required, is known as write amplification.

## Read:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSD read process involves receiving a logical address request, mapping it to a corresponding physical address using a mapping table, retrieving the data from the specified physical page and block in the NAND flash memory, and transferring the data to the requesting application or operating system.

## Update
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NAND-flash memory operates with a specific constraint: a page can be written to only if it is in the "free" state. When data needs to be changed or updated, the process involves a series of steps known as "read-modify-write." First, the content of the target page is copied into an internal register. Then, the required modifications are made to the data, and the updated version is stored in a different "free" page.
This "read-modify-write" operation occurs because the data cannot be updated in-place within the original page. Consequently, the "free" page, which is a separate and available page, is used to store the updated data. Once the new data has been successfully persisted to the drive, the original page is marked as "stale," indicating that it contains outdated information. The stale page remains in this state until it is eventually erased, and its space becomes available to be used for future write operations.
The "read-modify-write" process and the write amplification phenomenon described earlier are factors that affect the performance and lifespan of SSDs. Careful management of write operations and garbage collection techniques are employed to optimize SSD performance and ensure its long-term reliability.

## Garbage Collection:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garbage collection erases outdated data in SSDs, ensuring efficient write processing. Our simulator traces stale data, which can be deleted manually or after a set time. This optimizes SSD performance and maximizes usable capacity.


Witness the intelligent garbage collection process in action. Learn how the SSD manages free space by reclaiming invalid or deleted data, ensuring optimal utilization of the flash memory.
1. Mark-and-Sweep: This is one of the simplest and most basic garbage collection algorithms. It works by traversing the object graph, starting from a set of root objects, and marking all reachable objects. Then, it sweeps through the memory, deallocating any objects that were not marked.

2. Stop-and-Copy: This algorithm divides the memory into two halves: the "from" space and the "to" space. It starts by marking all reachable objects, and then it copies the live objects from the "from" space to the "to" space, updating all references accordingly. After the copying is complete, the roles of the two spaces are swapped, and the process repeats.

3. Mark-and-Compact: This algorithm is similar to the mark-and-sweep algorithm, but it includes an additional step of compacting the memory after marking. It moves the live objects closer together to eliminate fragmentation and improve memory locality.

4. Generational: This algorithm takes advantage of the observation that most objects become garbage relatively quickly after being allocated. It divides the heap into multiple generations based on the age of the objects. Younger objects are allocated in one generation, while older objects are allocated in other generations. Garbage collection is performed more frequently on the younger generations, while the older generations are collected less often.

5. Reference Counting: Unlike the previous algorithms, reference counting keeps track of the number of references to an object. Each object has a reference count associated with it, and when the count reaches zero, the object is considered garbage and can be deallocated. However, reference counting has the drawback of not being able to detect and collect cyclic references, where objects refer to each other in a cycle.

6. Concurrent and Parallel: These algorithms aim to minimize pauses or reduce the impact of garbage collection on the overall application performance. Concurrent garbage collectors perform garbage collection concurrently with the application, allowing it to continue executing while garbage collection is in progress. Parallel garbage collectors use multiple threads or processors to perform garbage collection in parallel, reducing the overall time spent on garbage collection.

These are some of the commonly used garbage collection algorithms, but there are variations and combinations of these algorithms as well. The choice of garbage collection algorithm depends on various factors, such as the programming language, runtime environment, and specific requirements of the application.

## Cache 
1. Least Recently Used (LRU): LRU is one of the most widely used cache replacement algorithms. It evicts the cache line that has not been accessed for the longest period of time. It assumes that the cache line that has been accessed least recently is the least likely to be accessed again in the near future.

2. First-In, First-Out (FIFO): FIFO is a simple cache replacement algorithm that evicts the cache line that was inserted first when the cache is full. It maintains a queue structure, and the cache line at the front of the queue is evicted. This algorithm does not consider the recency or frequency of cache line accesses.

3. Random Replacement: In this algorithm, a cache line is selected randomly for eviction when the cache is full. It does not consider any access patterns or history of cache line usage. Random replacement can be simple to implement, but it may not always result in optimal cache performance.

4. Least Frequently Used (LFU): LFU replaces the cache line that has been accessed the fewest number of times. It keeps track of the access frequency for each cache line and evicts the one with the lowest count. This algorithm assumes that cache lines with lower access frequency are less likely to be accessed in the future.

5. Most Recently Used (MRU): MRU evicts the cache line that has been accessed most recently. It assumes that recently accessed cache lines are more likely to be accessed again in the near future. MRU is useful in situations where temporal locality is important, but it can be less effective in handling certain access patterns.

6. Not Recently Used (NRU): NRU is a variation of the MRU algorithm that distinguishes between recently used and not recently used cache lines. It divides the cache lines into two categories: "recently used" and "not recently used." When eviction is required, it chooses a cache line from the "not recently used" category. This algorithm provides a simple approximation of LRU and is often used in hardware implementations due to its lower complexity.
